# About me

I'm 15 and I like playing games and making games. But I'm only learning gamedev right now... I use Unity to create games. My favorite games are NieR: Automata, Hollow Knight, Portal 2. I also have my own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Sikvoyo) (it's on Russian language though). It has 450 subscribers and I am kinda proud :) 

# My projects

Unfortunately, I don't have anything to share right now

# Working on

* I am working on Who Killed Mark? Who Killed Mark is a detective game about solving a murder case without any hints until timer runs out! Can you find the killer? I am planning to finish the game until July.
