I'm 15 and I live in Belarus. I like playing games, making games and spaghetti. But I'm only learning gamedev right now... I use Unity to create games. I am also learning 3D-modeling in Blender. My favorite games are NieR: Automata, Hollow Knight and Portal 2. I also have my own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Sikvoyo) (it's on Russian language though). It has 450 subscribers and I am kinda proud :) I like listening to music. My favorite artists are Дайте танк (!), Oxxxymiron, Валентин Стрыкало. And as you can see, I watch anime a little. My favorites are Neon Genesis Evangelion, Steins;Gate and Fullmetal Alchemist. I like Breaking Bad.

* I am working on Who Killed Mark? Who Killed Mark is a detective game about solving a murder case without any hints until timer runs out! Can you find the killer? I am planning to finish the game until July.
